## SimilarFilms using Flask

### This is incomplete - only the index is in a working state

This is the initial round of porting over [SimilarFilms](https://github.com/willsonsmith/similarfilms) to the Python Based [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) web framework. It is an experiment and currently has a number of visual bugs and legacy code. Still worth a look for educational purposes.

Everything (at least on the front end) so far is a direct copy of the original application, with a few bugs. There is leftover commented out code that is unnecessary.
