## SimilarFilms using flask

This is the initial round of porting over [SimilarFilms](https://github.com/willsonsmith/similarfilms) to the Python Based [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) web framework. It is an experiment and currently has a number of visual bugs and legacy code. Still worth a look for educational purposes.
